defmodule DevelopmentWeb.Showcase.Meta do
  @moduledoc """
  Authored, human-written metadata that can't be derived from the catalogs: a one-line
  description for every styled and headless component, and the styled↔headless cross-link map.

  Everything else on a component page (attributes, slots, real examples, the macro/override
  snippets) is *derived* from `priv/components/chelekom.json` and the `.exs` catalogs — so this
  module is the single place to curate prose. Add a component here and its page reads well; miss
  one and it falls back to a sensible generated sentence.
