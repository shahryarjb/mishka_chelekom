# Changelog for MishkaChelekom 0.0.10

### Features:
- Add a fourth `Chart` engine, TanStack Charts (`mix mishka.ui.gen.headless chart --lib tanstack`),
  over its framework-agnostic core. TanStack is a grammar of function calls, so the engine takes
  that grammar spelled as data — marks, scales and curves by name, rows as plain maps — with the x/y
  scales inferred when left out, ISO date strings parsed for time axes, and the `chelekom:*`
  formatter and fade sentinels working as they do on the other engines. Its SVG reads the
  `--chart-*` properties directly (a theme toggle recolors it with no redraw), a push animates to
  the new values, and the chart is keyboard-navigable. `@tanstack/charts` is MIT; the `d3-scale`
  and `d3-shape` it needs are pinned to the versions it pins itself, so they install once. Nothing
  changes in the component's markup or attributes
- The CMS bundle carries each attribute's own option list. A component's `args:` config already
  enumerates what `variant`, `color`, `size`, `rounded` and `padding` accept, and the exporter threw
  it away — a consumer had to recover the same lists from the `<%= if %>` gating around each helper
  clause, which is lossy (alert's fourteen colours came back as eleven). The list is now written onto
  the attribute as `opts.values`, where `attr :color, :string, values: [...]` would have put it, and
  is skipped for the few attributes whose own default contradicts it (`default: ""`), because a
  bundle whose components cannot be compiled is worse than one that says less about them. 23
  attributes carried a value list before; 364 do now
- The CMS bundle carries each component's `doc_url`, so a consumer can link to the page that explains
  the component it is offering
- The daisyUI gallery paints all 92 headless components with daisyUI and Tailwind classes in the
  examples' own markup. Copying an example gives you the component *and* its look; there is no
  stylesheet to take with it. The design system itself stays your dependency
- A `*_class` attribute for every part a component renders, so any part can be restyled from
  markup. This is what makes the class-only gallery possible, and it is enforced by a test that
  reads the components' own sources
- Known divergence from the stylesheet it replaces: a few parts whose CSS declared
  `color: var(--color-base-content)` no longer declare it, so under a **dark** `data-theme` they
  inherit the surrounding colour instead of following the theme (`slider` and its descendants,
  `pagination`'s ellipsis). Painting it back is not the fix — the declaration used to *lose* to
  daisyUI's own colour modifiers (`range-primary` and friends) from `@layer components`, and the
  same value written as a utility *wins*, flattening every coloured variant. Set the colour on
  your own container if you place these in a dark subtree
- Add 17 headless components, taking the line from 75 to 92: `alert`, `breadcrumb`, `button`,
  `calendar`, `card`, `carousel`, `countdown`, `dock`, `fab`, `file_input`, `pagination`, `rating`,
  `stepper`, `table`, `text_input`, `textarea` and `theme_controller`
- The headless `switch` takes `:on_icon` and `:off_icon` slots. Both render inside the track, after
  the thumb, and carry `data-checked`/`data-unchecked`, so a skin can cross-fade them rather than
  swapping one element for another

### Bug fixes:
- The `chart` docs told you to pick an engine with `--engine`; the flag is `--lib`
- The headless `radio_group` never went horizontal. Its root hardcoded `data-orientation="vertical"`
  while the JS engine was already reading that attribute to decide which arrow keys move the
  selection, so the option was unreachable: there is an `orientation` attribute now, and the
  keyboard follows it
- **Breaking**: `id` is required on the headless `avatar`. It was optional, but the hook that tracks
  the image's loading state keys off it, so an avatar without one silently never resolved its
  fallback. Phoenix reports the missing attribute at compile time, so an affected call site is a
  warning rather than something to hunt for at runtime
- A guarded helper clause keeps its discriminators. `Discriminators.extract_head/1` stripped the
  `when` guard when building its lookup key while the exporter wrote that guard INTO the clause's
  `args`, so the two signatures could never match and all 867 guarded clauses in the kit shipped with
  an empty `discriminators` list — most of the option lists a consumer needs to build a picker

- Add headless `Editor` component (TipTap 3 parity) — rich-text editing via an `Editor` JS engine (hook on an inner `phx-update="ignore"` surface, hidden textarea mirror so it submits as an ordinary form field, toolbar buttons wired by `data-editor-command`), with a Phoenix form demo
- Add npm dependency support to the generators — a component can declare `npm:` in its catalog and `mix mishka.ui.gen.headless <name>` installs it (npm/bun/yarn auto-detected, falling back to the `{:bun, ...}` hex binary so no system Node is required), gitignores `assets/node_modules` and prepends the install to the `assets.setup`/`build`/`deploy` aliases so CI and Docker builds work. `--no-npm` skips the install; npm-backed components are excluded from `mix mishka.ui.gen.*.components` unless named explicitly or `--with-npm` is passed

- Add headless `Tree` component — Mantine's Tree converted to a Phoenix headless component, with expand/collapse, single/multiple and shift-range selection, cascading checkboxes (with indeterminate) or `check_strictly`, WAI-ARIA treeview keyboard navigation, drag & drop, and server-driven async child loading
- Add Base UI gallery example and live server-driven examples (controller, form, single event, async, drag & drop, search) for the `Tree` component
- Add headless `EmptyState` component — Mantine's EmptyState converted to a Phoenix headless component: an optional indicator, `title`/`description` shorthands, extra body content and an actions row, aligned via `data-align` (left/center/right); ships no colors, spacing or role (presentational — add `role="status"` for dynamically shown states)
- Add headless `CloseButton` component (Mantine parity) — an icon-only button with a required `aria-label`, custom-icon slot and `data-disabled`
- Add headless `Burger` component (Mantine parity) — a hamburger navigation toggle with `aria-expanded`/`aria-controls` and `data-opened`
- Add headless `Chip` component (Mantine parity) — a selectable pill backed by a native checkbox/radio input, checked styling via `:has(:checked)`
- Add headless `Pill` component (Mantine parity) — a compact tag/token with an optional accessible remove button and `data-disabled`
- Add headless `TagsInput` component (Mantine parity) — removable tokens plus a draft input; add via a form `phx-submit` or `on_add`, remove via `on_remove`, click-to-focus via `JS.focus`, no JS hook
- Add headless `Spoiler` component (Mantine parity) — clamp long content behind a Show more / Show less toggle via `JS.toggle_attribute`, no JS hook

- Add headless `Code` component (Mantine parity) — inline `<code>` or a `<pre><code>` block
- Add headless `Mark` component (Mantine parity) — highlight an inline run of text with `<mark>`
- Add headless `VisuallyHidden` component (Mantine parity) — hide content visually while keeping it available to screen readers
- Add headless `ThemeIcon` component (Mantine parity) — a container that wraps an icon, decorative or labelled
- Add headless `ActionIcon` component (Mantine parity) — an icon-only action button with a required accessible label
- Add headless `Anchor` component (Mantine parity) — a plain, themeable link
- Add headless `Marquee` component (Mantine parity) — seamless CSS-only scrolling row (content duplicated, second copy `aria-hidden`), no JS hook
- Add headless `NumberFormatter` component (Mantine parity) — render-time number formatting with thousands/decimal separators and prefix/suffix, no JS
- Add headless `HueSlider` component (Mantine parity) — a 0–360° hue picker reusing the shared `Slider` engine, no new JS
- Add headless `AlphaSlider` component (Mantine parity) — a 0–100 opacity picker reusing the shared `Slider` engine, no new JS
- Add headless `Splitter` component (Mantine parity) — two resizable panes via a `Splitter` JS engine (pointer drag + keyboard, `role="separator"`)
- Add headless `Scroller` component (Mantine parity) — horizontal scroll row with prev/next controls via a `Scroller` JS engine (ResizeObserver end-detection)
- Add headless `RollingNumber` component (Mantine parity) — animate a number to its value via a `RollingNumber` JS engine (rAF, reduced-motion aware)
- Add headless `ColorPicker` component (Mantine parity) — saturation/value drag area + hue slider via a `ColorPicker` JS engine (HSV↔hex, hidden input for forms)
- Add headless `Highlight` component (Mantine parity) — wrap case-insensitive matches of one or more query terms in `<mark>` at render time, no JS
- Add headless `SemiCircleProgress` component (Mantine parity) — a half-circle SVG gauge (`role="progressbar"`) computed at render time, no JS
- Add headless `NavLink` component (Mantine parity) — a nav item that's a `<.link>` leaf or a native `<details>` disclosure with nested children (`data-active`/`aria-current`), no JS
- Add headless `JsonInput` component (Mantine parity) — a JSON textarea with a server-validated `data-invalid` state (parse/format via `Jason` in LiveView), no JS
- Add headless `SegmentedControl` component (Mantine parity) — a row of native radios with `:has(:checked)` selection and Arrow-key navigation, no JS
- Add headless `LoadingOverlay` component (Mantine parity) — an absolute `role="status"` loader overlay toggled by `visible` (CSS fade), no JS
- Add headless `PillsInput` component (Mantine parity) — an input-shaped container for pills + a text field, click-to-focus via `JS.focus`, no JS hook

- Add headless `AngleSlider` component (Mantine parity) — circular 0–360° dial driven by an `AngleSlider` JS engine (pointer + arrow keys, `--angle` fill var), with a Phoenix form demo
- Add headless `OverflowList` component — single-row list that collapses overflow into a `+N` counter via an `OverflowList` `ResizeObserver` engine, with an `on_change` server round-trip demo
- Add headless `FloatingIndicator` component (Mantine parity) — a highlight box that measures and slides over the active target via a `FloatingIndicator` JS engine, with an `on_change` server round-trip demo
- Add headless `FloatingWindow` component (Mantine parity) — a draggable, clamped panel via a `FloatingWindow` JS engine (`on_move` server round-trip, non-drag handle controls), with a demo
- Add headless `ColorInput` component (Mantine parity) — hex field + swatch opening a color picker popover (reuses the `ColorPicker` engine with two-way hex editing, JS-command popover), with a Phoenix form demo
- Add headless `TreeSelect` component (Mantine parity) — a JS-command disclosure that opens a `tree` in a popover to pick a value, with a Phoenix form demo wiring the tree's `on_select`
- Add `Mishka Tools` documentation button to headless component pages, and point `ARIA pattern` at the component's `spec_url` instead of its docs URL
- Add per-option tagged, base-first `examples` to `mix mishka.ui.export --cms`: every component now ships at least one example, ordered base-first, with `extra.examples[]` carrying `label`/`section`/`base`/`requires` so a consumer can hide an example whose variant was not installed [Commit](https://github.com/mishka-group/mishka_chelekom/commit/65764c5e)
- Add `## Examples` docs to `label/1`, `error/1`, `header/1` and `simple_form/1`, so every public component function documents its usage
- Add headless `Chart` component — one charting API over three swappable engines: Apache ECharts by default, Chart.js or billboard.js on request. Each engine installs under a single file name, so switching engines replaces the vendored file instead of stacking them, and every engine is exact-pinned and permissively licensed
- Add headless `Sparkline` component — a server-rendered SVG trend line with no npm package, no scripts and no JS hook, so it renders in a table cell, a stat card or an email, whichever chart engine (if any) you generated
- Add `decode_atom_map/1` beside the `__atom_map__` encoder, so a consumer can read a bundle's encoded atom keys back without reimplementing the format

### Mob (native Android and iOS):

Mob renders native Jetpack Compose and SwiftUI from Elixir. Every component below is a native port
of its headless counterpart — the same props and the same event contract, with no styling of its
own — generated by `mix mishka.ui.gen.mob` and written as a tag, `<Accordion />`, exactly like the
Phoenix component it mirrors.

- Add `mix mishka.ui.gen.mob`, `mix mishka.ui.gen.mob.components` and `mix mishka.ui.gen.mob.kit` to generate native Mob components into a Mob application, honouring `--module-prefix` and carrying each component's kit dependencies with it

### Refactors:

- Refactor the `--cms` export example pipeline into `CmsBundle.{DocExamples, DocsPage, Examples, Sanitize}`, harvesting from each function's `@doc` fences and the docs pages' `code_string/1` snippets rather than the demo markup
- Update `phoenix_live_view` to 1.2.7 [Commit](https://github.com/mishka-group/mishka_chelekom/commit/85d3bf5f)
- Point `doc_url` at mishka.tools and preserve the specification URLs under `spec_url` [Commit](https://github.com/mishka-group/mishka_chelekom/commit/6e4db073)
- Add the Headless section to the README [Commit](https://github.com/mishka-group/mishka_chelekom/commit/c23668dc)
- Tighten all 116 usage rules, fix the Kit doc, bump versions and add the v0.0.9 roadmap [Commit](https://github.com/mishka-group/mishka_chelekom/commit/080e90fd)
- Shorten every usage rule [Commit](https://github.com/mishka-group/mishka_chelekom/commit/f6f8594f)

### Bugs:

- Fix missing `component_prefix` in components [Commit](https://github.com/mishka-group/mishka_chelekom/commit/fc2e7edc)
- Fix Tabs not showing a pointer cursor on hover over tab triggers [#491](https://github.com/mishka-group/mishka_chelekom/pull/491)
- Fix avatar not forwarding standard `img` attributes (`alt`, `srcset`, `loading`, `width`…) via `:global` include [Commit](https://github.com/mishka-group/mishka_chelekom/commit/e08098c1)
- Fix Elixir 1.20 type-checker warnings in stepper and table_content [Commit](https://github.com/mishka-group/mishka_chelekom/commit/bb94d8f8)
- Fix dev harness headless CSS copy drifting from the `priv` source [Commit](https://github.com/mishka-group/mishka_chelekom/commit/9ccaf8d1)
- Fix `--cms` export shipping no examples for 53 of 136 components: the form components' docs pages were never vendored, nested-only components (`card_title`, `td`, `progress_section`…) were skipped by the extractor, and the literal-only filter discarded every snippet that referenced a demo assign (`pagination` harvested 111 examples and shipped 0)
- Fix `DemoHarness` not passing `extra.clauses`, `extra.prelude` and `extra.module_attributes` to the component compiler, so every multi-clause component was compiled from its first clause only and guarded clauses were never exercised
- Fix component compiler dropping multi-clause guards, which made all nine form-field components raise `FunctionClauseError` on render with their default `floating` value
- Fix `file_field` dropzone never opening the file picker: `live_file_input/1` identifies its input by the upload ref and ignores a caller `id`, so the label's `for` resolved to nothing and the label lost its control entirely. The label now points at `@upload.ref`, the caller's `id` moves to the wrapper, and the previously undeclared `upload` attribute is declared [#496](https://github.com/mishka-group/mishka_chelekom/issues/496)
