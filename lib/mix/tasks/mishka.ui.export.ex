  @shortdoc "A Mix Task for generating a JSON file from a directory of components"

  @moduledoc """
  #{@shortdoc}

  This Mix Task helps you generate a JSON file from the files in a directory,
  enabling you to use it with `mix mishka.ui.add` or share it in the community version.

  Keep in mind that for each component, you must have both `.eex` and `.exs` files according to the
  documentation of the [Mishka Chelekom](https://github.com/mishka-group/mishka_chelekom) library.
  Otherwise, you will need to create the necessary files manually.
  It’s recommended to review the Core components and follow their structure as a guide.

  If you prefer to perform the process manually, simply add the relevant option to your command to
  generate a template file. You can then customize it based on your specific requirements.

  **Note**:

  > Use `--base64` option to convert the file content to Base64 if you're using special Erlang
  characters that do not retain their original form when converted back to the original file.

  **Note**:

  It is important to note that to place each file in its designated section and specify its type,
  you must use the following naming convention:

  For example, if your file is a `component`, you need to have two files:

  - `component_something.exs`
  - `component_something.eex`

  Similarly, for other file types like `preset` and `template`, you should follow the same
  naming pattern as above. For instance:

  - `template_something.exs`
  - `template_something.eex`

  All files within the directory do not need to have the same name. However,
  they must start with the section name where they are intended to be placed, such as
  `component`, `preset`, or `template`. Additionally, each file must have both the
  `exs` and `eex` formats.

  > **Note**: Since JavaScript files do not require configuration, you only need to
  place the file in the directory. For example: `something.js`

  ### What Should the Configuration of Each Component Look Like?
  If you take a look at the example configuration below, you'll notice that the component
  file name matches the key name in the list, which also matches the configuration name.
  This ensures consistency and makes it easier to work with the component configuration.

  **File name**: `component_accordion.eex` and `component_accordion.exs`
  ```elixir
  [
    component_accordion: [
      name: "component_accordion",
      args: [...]
      ...
    ]
  ]
  ```

  **Note:** you can name this like `preset_accordion` or `template_accordion` too.

  ## Example

  ```bash
  #{@example}
  ```

  Export the built-in styled components as a MishkaCMS UI-kit bundle:

  ```bash
  mix mishka.ui.export priv/components --cms --name chelekom --bundle-name chelekom --bundle-version 0.0.9
  ```

  Export the headless Kit components as a MishkaCMS UI-kit bundle:

  ```bash
  mix mishka.ui.export priv/headless --cms --name chelekom_headless --bundle-name chelekom_headless --bundle-version 0.0.9
  ```

  ## Options

  * `--base64` or `-b` - Converts component content to Base64
  * `--name` or `-n` - Defines a name for JSON file, if it is not set default is template.json
  * `--org` or `-o` - It is only for structuring the file and has no effect on your export.
  * `--template` or `-t` - Creates a default JSON file for manual processing steps.
  * `--cms` - Exports a MishkaCMS UI-kit bundle (`mishka.ui_kit.bundle.v3`) instead of the default JSON.
  * `--bundle-name` - Sets the bundle name in `--cms` output (defaults to the `--name` value).
  * `--bundle-version` - Sets the bundle version in `--cms` output (defaults to `0.0.1`).

  ## What a component's `.exs` can say to the consuming CMS

  Beside `necessary` — which names the OTHER components this one draws through — three keys describe
  what the CMS must do with this component itself. All are optional and all default to `false`, so a
  `.exs` written before they existed keeps its meaning exactly.

      required: true     # the CMS cannot run without it; its installer may not let it be deselected
      precompile: true   # build its CSS whether or not a page names it
      stateful: true     # install it as a Phoenix.LiveComponent, not a function component

  `precompile` exists because a consuming CMS builds a site's stylesheet from the components its
  pages REFERENCE, and a component reached through helper code or the host's own markup is invisible
  to that walk. Saying so here is the only way it can be known.

  `priv/components/icon.exs` is the example: 49 of this kit's components declare it `necessary`, so
  deselecting it would leave a third of the kit unable to draw.

  ## Shipping a live component

  A `stateful` component gets an id, assigns of its own that survive the hosting page's re-renders,
  and `handle_event/3` aimed at itself rather than at the page. Write its `.eex` as a
  `Phoenix.LiveComponent` module — one `render/1` carrying the `~H`, with `mount/1`, `update/2` and
  `handle_event/3` beside it — and the exporter names the row after the `.exs`'s own `name` instead
  of after `render`, which every one of them would otherwise be called.

  Three shapes the exporter refuses, because the consuming CMS refuses them too:

    * more than one public component in the file — a live component IS its module
    * a dispatching `def` with several clauses — each clause has its own root element, and a live
      component may have exactly one
    * an `attr` named `uploads`, `streams`, `socket` or `myself` — LiveView assigns those itself

  Say it in the `.exs`. `use Phoenix.LiveComponent` in the `.eex` on its own is a warning and not a
  declaration: the bundle carries what the config says.
